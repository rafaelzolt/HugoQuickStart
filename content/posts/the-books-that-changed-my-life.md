I believe books are one of the best investments you can make. 

## Books are great for learning new topics

When asked Elon Musc how he learns new topics his answer was:

" I read books".

Sounds too simple but If you think more deeply about it, it's actually a powerful idea. 

 You can learn anything if by reading books, from rocket science, programming, to economics. 

But there is one part missing, it's not just passive reading you have to practice it.

Isn't how they do in university. Teachers have a book they follow and have test to assess the students knowledge so you can do it at you own rithm 

## Books are like good conversations with smart people

Through books, you can 

## Books inspire you and change your belives

## Books don't have built-in distractions.

Adds, recommendations 

etc

## Books are timeless
