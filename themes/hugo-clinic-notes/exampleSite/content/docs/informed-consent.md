## Informed Consent Notice

- Our session today is not designed to fully replace an in-person assessment by a qualified professional
- I cannot perform a regular, full physical assessment of you and so I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of your injury or condition, but only provide guidance and advice on some possible diagnoses and how you may deal with them
- If you take any action on this advice and guidance, it is your own responsibility to ensure your safety and comfort at all times, particularly if performing physical exercises
- You must seek further guidance from me or another qualified professional if you are at all unsure, or feel pain and/or excessive discomfort, during these exercises

Does that sound ok?

Do you have any questions?
