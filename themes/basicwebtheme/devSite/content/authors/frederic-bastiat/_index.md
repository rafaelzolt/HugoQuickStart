Claude-Frédéric Bastiat (June 30, 1801 – December 24, 1850) was a French economist, writer and a prominent member of the French Liberal School.

A Freemason and a member of the French National Assembly, Bastiat developed the economic concept of opportunity cost and introduced the parable of the broken window.[2]

As an advocate of classical economics and the economics of Adam Smith, his views favored a free market and influenced the Austrian School.
