Lysander Spooner (January 19, 1808 â€“ May 14, 1887) was an American political philosopher, essayist, pamphlet writer, Unitarian, abolitionist, individualist anarchist, legal theorist, a member of the socialist First International and entrepreneur of the 19th century.

Spooner was a strong advocate of the labor movement and anti-authoritarian and individualist anarchist in his political views. His economic and political ideology has often been identified as libertarian socialism and mutualism. Spooner's writings contributed to the development of both left-libertarian and right-libertarian political theory within libertarianism in the United States.

Spooner's writing includes the abolitionist book The Unconstitutionality of Slavery and No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority which opposed treason charges against secessionists. He is also known for competing with the Post Office with his American Letter Mail Company. However, it was closed after legal problems with the federal government.
