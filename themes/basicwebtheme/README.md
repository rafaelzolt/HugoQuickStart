# Basic Web Theme

The Basic Web Theme is simple, minimal and usable.

This minimalist design is motivated by a vision of the web where
authors publish content in a sane, accessible layout, and defer to
user stylesheets for styling, so each user pulls content from the
author and then displays the content in a way that works best for
them... dark-mode, light-mode, large fonts, small fonts... every user
has different preferences and needs.

The separation of content and presentation was a fundamental concept
for Web 1.0, and the concept is pushed even further in the Semantic
Web. This theme aims to support that concept.

The implementation goal of Basic Web Theme is to use default user
agent styles as much as possible. Styles are tweaked to improve
usability: limiting column width, scaling for mobile devices, making
tables look nice, scrolling code blocks properly, etc.

Use of CSS classes for styling is kept to a minimum to make it simple for
user stylesheets to override HTML elements in a predictable way.

Think about it: no one is impressed by your cool web design.
